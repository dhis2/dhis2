/**
 * The {@link JsonValue} is a virtual read-only view for JSON responses.
 *
 * As usual there are specific node types for the JSON building blocks:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link JsonObject}</li>
 * <li>{@link JsonArray}</li>
 * <li>{@link JsonString}</li>
 * <li>{@link JsonNumber}</li>
 * <li>{@link JsonBoolean}</li>
 * </ul>
 * In addition there is {@link JsonCollection} as a common base type of
 * {@link JsonObject} and {@link JsonArray} and {@link JsonPrimitive} as common
 * base type of {@link JsonString}, {@link JsonNumber} and {@link JsonBoolean}.
 *
 * In addition {@link JsonList} is a typed JSON array of uniform elements (which
 * can be understood as a typed wrapper around a {@link JsonArray}.
 *
 * Similarly {@link JsonMap} is a typed JSON object map of uniform values (which
 * can be understood as a typed wrapper around a {@link JsonObject}.
 *
 * The API is designed to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>be extended by further types extending {@link JsonValue}, such as
 * {@link JsonDate} but also further specific object types</li>
 * <li>fail at point of assertion. This means traversing the virtual tree does
 * not cause errors unless explicitly provoked.</li>
 * <li>be implemented by a single class which only builds a lookup path and
 * checks or provides the leaf values on demand. Interfaces not directly
 * implemented by this class are dynamically created using a
 * {@link java.lang.reflect.Proxy}.</li>
 * </ul>
